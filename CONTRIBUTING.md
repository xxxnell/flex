# Contributing to Flip

This guide is for people who would like to be involved in building *Flip*.

*Flip* welcomes contributions from everyone. Any kind of contribution is helpful: writing  a unit test, documentation, fixing bugs, advicing on work-in-progress, developing a new feature, implementing the algorithm of `Sketch` in another language, and so on. It is also good to refer to the [Waffle](https://waffle.io/xxxnell/flip) to find open issues.


## Submitting a pull request

This project follows a standard [fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) model for contributions via GitHub pull requests.
 
* Pull requests should be submitted from a separate `feature` branch starting from the `develop` branch (e.g. `using git checkout -b "feature/username/fix-123"`). Especially, note that the `master` branch of this repository contains the latest stable release of *Flip*. For more detail, see [git-flow cheatsheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html).
* Commit messages should general use the present tense, normal sentence capitalization, and no final punctuation.
* The commit message should be written like a mini changelog. The commit message should have the following prefix: `*` when the code or functionality changes. `+` when new code or functionality is added. `-` when redundant or unnecessary code or functionality is removed.
* It is recommended that the first line of the commit message should not exceed 72 characters.
* The updated code must be checked its code style using [scalafmt](http://scalameta.org/scalafmt/#sbt).
